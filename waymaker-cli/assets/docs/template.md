# Templating Rules

Matchmaker uses a template system for formatting output and executing commands.
Templates use `{}` placeholders with various modifiers to inject item data.

>[!NOTE]
> Only valid keys are replaced, invalid keys are left alone. If you need it, you can also escape `{` like `\{`.

## Modifiers

| Modifier | Description                                        |
| -------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `{}`     | Current item (shell-quoted)                        |
| `{=}`    | Current item (no quotes)                           |
| `{+}`    | All selected items (shell-quoted, space-separated) |
| `{-}`    | All selected items (no quotes, space-separated)    |

*Note: This outputs the original line (after possible trimming and ansi processing), and is not the same as {..} below.*

## Column Specifics

You can specify a column by its name or by its index (starting from 1).

Note that the default column names (when `columns.names` is unspecified) are `1` … `columns.max`.

**Note: Column names must be alphanumeric.**

| Placeholder | Description                                       |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `{col}`     | Column `col` of current item (shell-quoted)       |
| `{=col}`    | Column `col` of current item (raw)                |
| `{+col}`    | Column `col` of all selected items (shell-quoted) |
| `{-col}`    | Column `col` of all selected items (raw)          |

## Special

`!` refers to the active column.
`#` refers to the active index.

See examples for more information.

## Command Line Arguments

If you passed trailing arguments to `wm` (after `--`), you can access them in your templates.

| Placeholder | Description                                   |
| ----------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| `{$0}`      | All arguments (shell-quoted, space-separated) |
| `{$1}`      | The first argument (shell-quoted)             |
| `{$n}`      | The n-th argument                             |

## Ranges

Column ranges can be specified.

| Placeholder    | Description                                                |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| `{col1..col2}` | Columns from `col1` to `col2` (exclusive), space-separated |
| `{col..}`      | From column `col` to the end                               |
| `{..col}`      | From the first column to `col` (exclusive)                 |
| `{..}`         | All visible columns                                        |

Modifiers (`=`, `+`, `-`) also apply to ranges.

## Examples

### Configuration (`config.toml`)

#### Custom Preview Command

Use `{}` to pass the current item to a previewer like `bat` or `eza`.

```toml
[[preview.layout]]
command = "bat --color=always {} || eza -T {}"
```

#### Keybindings with Shell Execution

You can bind keys to run shell commands.

```toml
[binds]
"ctrl-o" = "Execute($EDITOR {})" # Open in editor and return to waymaker
"alt-o" = "Become($EDITOR {})" # Open in editor and exit waymaker
"ctrl-y" = "Execute(echo -n {} | xclip -sel clip)" # Copy to clipboard
```

#### Output Formatting

Change how the selected item is printed to stdout when you press enter.

```toml
[start]
output_template = "Selected: {}"
```

### Command Line (CLI)

Output the shell-quoted result.

```
find . | wm o "{}"
```

#### Multi-Column Preview

If your input has columns (e.g., from `ls -l`), you can preview a specific column.

```bash
ls -l | wm d " +" m.max_columns=9 px "echo 'File: {=9}'" h.header_lines 1 m.default_column 9 h.content="|||"
```

*Note: `{=9}` uses the unquoted value of the 9th column (index 9).*

#### Active Column

The `{!}` placeholder refers to the column currently under focus (specified by `%column_name` in your query).

```bash
wm px "echo 'You are currently filtering on: {!}'"
```

#### Index

The `{#}` placeholder resolves to the absolute index of the item.

```bash
wm px "echo 'You are currently selecting items: #{+#}'"
```

#### Ranges

Join multiple columns together. `{2..}` joins the 2nd column to the end.

```bash
ls -l | wm d " +" h.h 1 px "echo 'Metadata: {=2..}'"
```

*Note: `h.h` is short for `header.header_lines`.*

#### Action on Selection

Execute a command with all selected items when pressing a custom key.

```bash
touch a b
wm b.ctrl-x "ExecuteSilent(rm {+}) Reload" x ls # Delete items then reload
```

## Status Line and Input Prompt Templates

The status line supports dynamic variables, and alignment.
With the `SetStyledStatus` action, it, along with the input prompt (by `SetStyledPrompt`), also supports styling.

### Styling

You can style parts of the status line and input prompt using the `{fg,bg,..modifiers:text}` syntax.

- `{red:Error:}` renders "Error:" in red.
- `{,blue:Matchmaker}` renders "Matchmaker" in a blue background.
- `{red,bold,italic:Caution}` renders "Caution" in red, with bold and italic modifiers.

### Variables

The following variables are available and must be prefixed with a backslash (`\`):

| Variable | Description                                   |
| -------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| `\r`     | Current row index (0-indexed cursor position) |
| `\m`     | Number of matched items                       |
| `\t`     | Total number of items                         |

### Alignment

Use `\s` and `\S` to insert flexible whitespace for alignment.

- A single `\s` will expand to fill the remaining width of the terminal, pushing subsequent text to the right.
- If multiple `\s` are used, the available space is distributed equally between them.
- `\S` increases the distribution denominator without adding any whitespace.

## Environment Variables

When Matchmaker executes a command (e.g., via `Execute`, `Become`, or a preview command), it injects several environment variables that you can use in your scripts.

| Variable             | FZF Equivalent     | Description                                        |
| -------------------- | ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `MM_LINES`           | `FZF_LINES`        | Height of the terminal                             |
| `MM_COLUMNS`         | `FZF_COLUMNS`      | Width of the terminal                              |
| `MM_TOTAL_COUNT`     | `FZF_TOTAL_COUNT`  | Total number of items                              |
| `MM_MATCH_COUNT`     | `FZF_MATCH_COUNT`  | Number of matched items                            |
| `MM_SELECT_COUNT`    | `FZF_SELECT_COUNT` | Number of selected items                           |
| `MM_POS`             | `FZF_POS`          | Current row index (0-indexed cursor position)      |
| `MM_QUERY`           | `FZF_QUERY`        | Current input query                                |
| `MM_PREVIEW_COMMAND` |                    | The current preview command                        |
| `MM_OVERRIDE`        |                    | Path of the last applied override                  |
| `MM_STORE`           |                    | Current value stored in state (via `Store` action) |
| `MM_INDEX`           |                    | Index of command being reloaded (in `ReloadNext`)  |

The `envs` section of your config is also injected, as well as `$CLIPcmd` and `$PASTEcmd` -- the auto-determined clipboard commands if they are not otherwise set.

### Preview Environment

In addition to the above, commands executed within the preview window also receive:

| Variable  | Description                |
| --------- | -------------------------- |
| `LINES`   | Height of the preview area |
| `COLUMNS` | Width of the preview area  |

## Interaction Regions

Interaction regions allow you to trigger [semantic actions](binds.md#semantic-triggers) by clicking on specific areas of the `header`, `footer`, or `status` line.

### Configuration

Interactions are defined as a list of `(index, action)` pairs:

- `index`: The 0-based horizontal character offset from the left of the UI component.
- `action`: The name of the semantic trigger to activate (e.g., `"foo"` for `@foo`).

When a region is clicked, Matchmaker finds the entry with the largest `index` that is less than or equal to the click position and triggers the associated action. An empty action string (`""`) can be used to disable interaction for a specific range.

### Example

In your `config.toml`:

```toml
[status]
template = "{red: [X]} {green: [OK]} \s \m/\t"
interactions = [
    [1, "quit"],   # Trigger @quit
    [4, ""],       # Gap (no action)
    [6, "accept"], # Trigger @accept
    [11, ""]       # Disable for the rest of the line
]

[binds]
"@quit" = "Quit"
"@accept" = "Accept"
```

For `header` and `footer`, which can have multiple lines, `interactions` is a list of lists (one for each line).
